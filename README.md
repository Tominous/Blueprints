<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Blueprints mod uses knowledge books added in 1.12 to make Minecraft more exciting and challenging. How does it work? You can't craft item if you don't have unlocked recipe for it. How do I unlock recipes? You can find different tiers of blueprints (knowledge books) in different locations. It forces you to explore the map instead of spending hours mining in caves. When connected with Minecraft's hardcore mode it gets more interesting. Using it on a multiplayer fractions server make the gameplay 
unforgettable experience.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
